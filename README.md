- 👀 ...Hi! I'm a passionate high school student deeply interested in cybersecurity, quantitative finance, and ethical hacking. I'm currently learning SQL to build real-world projects and strengthen my
 foundation in database management and data analysis.

I aim to combine my technical skills with strategic thinking to solve real-world problems — from securing digital systems to analyzing market behavior. I’m also working towards gaining professional experience through 
freelancing and certifications, while preparing for my future studies.

"Learning never exhausts the mind, it fuels it."
